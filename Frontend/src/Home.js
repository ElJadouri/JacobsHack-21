            Welcome to Connect, we created this platform to reinforce
            communication inside our community. Replacing some forms of
            communication as spam or College office announcements and also
            making a place for you to announce, make plans, or also asking
            someone in your college for a charger late a night. Here you can
            join your College, Major, courses, clubs servers and start
            interracting through the Channel. Making communities well conneceted
            in bigger scales is a part of our view of tomorrow. Sign up or Log
            in to join your Major, College and floor channel automatically.
